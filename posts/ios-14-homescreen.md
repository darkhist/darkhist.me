iOS 14 is here, and so are lots of fancy looking home screens  
I thought I would share mine and how I made it!

## Method One

Customizing your home screen can be done pretty easily by following the steps below

> Note: using this method will **always** open the Shortcuts app briefly before actually launching an app which isn't great, but, hey, it works

1. Open Shortcuts
2. Tap the +
3. Select Scripting
4. Select Open App
5. Choose an app
6. Tap the three dots in the top right corner
7. Tap Add to Home Screen
8. Select a photo or icon for the app
9. Enter a label
10. Tap Add
11. **Repeat for every app you want to customize**

## Method Two

To get around this and open apps normally, follow these steps instead

### Setup

1. Go to Settings > Shortcuts > Toggle Allow Untrusted Shortcuts on
2. Get [Icon Themer](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6565/)
3. (Recommended) Go to Settings > Accessibility > Motion > Toggle Reduce Motion on

> Note: Here's the [RoutineHub FAQ](https://routinehub.co/faq/) and their [Privacy Policy](https://routinehub.co/privacy/#)

### Customizing Non-System Apps (Instagram, Notion, etc)

1. Open Shortcuts
2. Tap the Icon Themer shortcut
3. Tap Search in App Store
4. Type the name of the app you want to customize, then tap Done
5. Select the app (it should be the top result)
6. Choose an icon from your Photos Library or Files
7. Enter a label (I left all of mine blank)
8. Tap Done when prompted with the URL scheme
9. After being redirected to Safari, tap Allow
10. Go to Settings (you should see a downloaded profile at the top)
11. Select the profile, and tap Install
12. Enter your passcode, tap Install (at the top right corner), then tap Install again
13. **Repeat for every app you want to customize**

### Customizing System Apps (Phone, Messages, etc)

Customizing a system app is basically the same â€“ except for Step 3  
Tap System App instead of Search in App Store

> Note: Opening certain system apps also opens the Shortcuts app briefly before launching the app <span role="img" aria-label="sad face">:~(</span>

### Styling

Feel free to use whatever background / photos / icon set you'd like

I bought this [icon set from Traf](https://icons.tr.af/)

I used [Widgetsmith](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widgetsmith/id1523682319) to add the time and photo widgets

The photos on the first screen (from top to bottom) are courtesy of [Quibe](https://www.instagram.com/quibe/?hl=en) and [halfaroastchicken](https://www.instagram.com/halfaroastchicken/?hl=en), please consider supporting their work / giving them a follow!

The photo on the second screen is from an unknown source, please let me know if it's yours or if you know the name of the sculpture!
